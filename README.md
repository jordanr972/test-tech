Technical test case 

For the architectural choice I decided to organize by Features (this test does not have a lot of features so I considere each screen as a feature to display the seperation).

Usally I use Coordinator pattern but for the sake of the test I use Navigation Link directly in the Swiftui view.

 I focus on the main features of displaying the image automatically with a timer, navigating by tapping right or left and liking. I did not have time to finish all the features of the test or include unit test.
 
 I used json files as data source and generate image with dummyimage.com for the story's image. I reuse ImageCacheProtocol that I have previously found on another project.
 
 My main limitations were on hardware as I have not yet change my mackbook Air for a better one, getting back into Swift and SwiftUI after 6 months of Flutter and NestJs on a side project.
